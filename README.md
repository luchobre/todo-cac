# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run a React Vite project that you've downloaded from GitHub in your local folder, you'll need to follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/
Download the Project:

Go to the GitHub repository where the React Vite project is hosted.
Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the project as a ZIP file.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your local folder.
Navigate to the Project Directory:
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the project files using the cd command:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Replace path/to/your/project with the actual path to the project folder on your computer.

Install Dependencies:
Inside the project directory, you need to install the project's dependencies using npm. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the required packages and dependencies specified in the project's package.json file.

Run the Development Server:
To start the development server and run the React Vite app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command will start the development server, and your React Vite app will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. The development server will also provide hot-reloading, so any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

Build for Production (Optional):
If you want to build the React Vite app for production, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This command will generate an optimized build of your application in the dist folder. You can then deploy the contents of this folder to a web server or hosting platform.

That's it! You've successfully downloaded and run a React Vite project from GitHub in your local folder. You can now work on the project, make changes, and test it locally.
